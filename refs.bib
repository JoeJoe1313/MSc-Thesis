edition = {Sixth edition / Keith Wesley, MD, FACEP.},
keywords = {Arrhythmia},
abstract = {This edition uses a step-by-step approach to help you build skills in accurate rhythm interpretation, diagnosis, and clinical management. Correlating ECG interpretation with clinical signs and symptoms, the text begins with basic skills and progresses to more advanced concepts. Hundreds of ECG rhythm strips provide plenty of practice with identifying heart rhythms. Written by experienced EMS physician and educator Keith Wesley, this guide is also ideal for quick reference while on the job, anywhere from the emergency department to the back of an ambulance. Comprehensive review of heart rhythm interpretation reflects current ECC guidelines. Logical organisation of material teaches the way in which readers learn specific skills - ECG components are presented first, followed by rhythm interpretation and then clinical applications.},

abstract = {In this paper we formulate the nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) problem as a maximum likelihood estimation problem for hidden Markov models and propose online expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithms to estimate the NMF and the other unknown static parameters. We also propose a sequential Monte Carlo approximation of our online EM algorithm. We show the performance of the proposed method with two numerical examples.}
